## Documentation tracker

What I am planning to document:
- [x] Write an overview with some photographs of what was done
- [ ] Describe the electronic part of the project
- [ ] Describe the client-side software part of the project
- [ ] Describe configuring ThingsBoard and wiring it together
- [ ] Write about all the interesting gotchas.

## Overview

It all really started with the lockdown. Wait, no, it all started even before
that - when we moved to our new house, we decided to build a home office in our
garden, which in the long run turned out to be one of the best decisions we've
ever made. We used it to work from home over evenings (because managing two full
time careers and kids is tough, d'oh).

Then lockdown happened and we started working from our office full time - again,
building it was the best decision we made in a long time (as we've made a number
of poor ones too in comparison). When it was warm and we kept windows open
everything was just fine, but problems started to arise as winter hit (with
temperature hitting negative Celsius every now and again) and doors and windows
becoming permanently closed - the little building (something like 5x3.5) just
didn't have enough of oxygen to support two people working full time (with a
bunch of computers running just as well).

I mean, opening windows every now and again and going out would be easy, but we
are not looking for easy ways, right? One cannot improve what one cannot
measure, so I started this project.

When everything is wired together and working, here's what I see in ThingsBoard:
